import { Playground } from "remark-playground";

import { Card } from "../components/Card";

import Callout from "./../components/Callout";

Designed to works with MDX files, `Playground` is a remark plugin that can be used in many React frameworks, like Next, Remix, Astro, and Gatsby. With just one step configuration you can use `Playground` to provide super powers for your components examples, and docs.

`Playground` enables you to create interactive and engaging examples of your components that can be easily customized and shared with others. The plugin supports live code editing and rendering, allowing you to quickly and easily experiment with different configurations and settings for your components.

## Quick Setup

To get started with `Playground`, you can install it using your preferred package manager:

```bash
npm install remark-playground --save
```

To use `Playground` with a specific React framework, you'll need to configure remark within that framework. Here's how to set it up with some popular frameworks:

<Callout type="info">
  Playground is a JavaScript module that is written in ECMAScript (ES) modules
  format (ESM), and it requires a module-aware environment to run properly. This
  means that if you are using Playground with a framework that supports ES
  modules, you should use the .mjs extension for your configuration file, and
  the module should be imported using the ESM syntax.
</Callout>

### Next.js

To use `Playground` with Next.js, you'll need to add a `next.config.mjs` file to the root of your project with the following content:

```js
const withMDX = require("@next/mdx")({
  extension: /\.mdx?$/,
  options: {
    remarkPlugins: [require("remark-playground/plugin")],
  },
});

module.exports = withMDX();
```

This will configure Next.js to use Playground with MDX files in your project.

### Remix

To use `Playground` with Remix, you'll need to add a `mix.config.js` file to the root of your project with the following content:

```js
const mixMDX = require("@remix-run/mdx");
const remarkPlugins = [require("remark-playground/plugin")];

module.exports = mixMDX.default({
  remarkPlugins,
});
```

This will configure Remix to use `Playground` with MDX files in your project.

### Astro

To use Playground with Astro, you'll need to add a `astro.config.mjs` file to the root of your project with the following content:

```js
import { createPlugin } from "astro";
import remark from "remark";
import remarkPrism from "@mapbox/remark-prism";
import playground from "remark-playground/plugin";

export default {
  plugins: [
    createPlugin({
      name: "remark",
      plugins: [playground, [remarkPrism, { ignoreMissing: true }], remark()],
    }),
  ],
};
```

This will configure Astro to use `Playground` with MDX files in your project.

### Gatsby

To use `Playground` with Gatsby, you'll need to add a `gatsby-config.js` file to the root of your project with the following content:

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: "gatsby-plugin-mdx",
      options: {
        gatsbyRemarkPlugins: [
          {
            resolve: "gatsby-remark-vscode",
            options: {
              theme: "Dark+ (default dark)",
              extensions: ["theme-darcula"],
              inlineCode: {
                marker: ">",
              },
            },
          },
        ],
        remarkPlugins: [require("remark-slug")],
        remarkPlugins: [require("remark-playground/plugin")],
      },
    },
  ],
};
```

This will configure Gatsby to use `Playground` with MDX files in your project.

## Usage

Once you have set up `Playground`, you can begin using it to create examples and documentation for your components. You can customize the appearance and behavior of your examples using a wide range of settings and options, including CSS, JavaScript, and HTML.

For example, you can use the `Playground` component to create an interactive example of a button component:

```mdx
import Playground from 'remark-playground';

import Button '...'

# Button

The `Button` component is a simple button that can be used in your application.

<Playground>
  <Button>Click me</Button>
</Playground>
```

This will render an interactive example of the Button component that users can play with and customize. You can also use Playground to create more complex examples and documentation, depending on your needs.
